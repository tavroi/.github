With the expansion of meta-verse  across different sectors and growing 
adoption, everyone is launching their respective meta-verse platforms, 
where user has been given liberty to create their Avatars, based on our 
present industry focus these are Travel platform, Airports, Tourism, BFSI, 
Insurance and Mobility sectors. With multiple identities created cross 
different meta verse platform, this will lead to a major disconnect on the 
behavior, like Socio-economic factors, User Interest, actionable insights,  
meta data, Alternative data and Real world Identity Data points will be 
only limited to the respective platform.  
 
 We at Verismart solving this problem with our MetaSmart ID and Data 
exchange platform, where we are leveraging privacy compliant data 
sharing and Meta ID interoperability across different platforms, this will 
help bring the entire user behavior and respective actionable insights of 
the user in Meta-verse space and bring a collaborative experience for 
them.  
 

 
 
For this we have created different Data sharing protocols on our 
blockchain framework which will lead to this Data and ID interoperability
